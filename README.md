# Java_Package
Package gives segregation based on the specification we want
In one Package,we can not create classes with same name
In different packages, we can create class with same name
Package should not start with '.' or special characters
Com.dilsha.test
Each one is a folder[ com,dilsha and test folders ]
If we do not create any  package ,it will take default package-->but it won't show any folder ,the class files are within the src folder only!
